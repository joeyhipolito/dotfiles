# Dotfiles(Joey Hipolito)
My ubuntu bash configuration files

## How to use
You can either git clone this repository and copy the dotfiles in your home directory like so:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:joeyhipolito/dotfiles.git
```

## Customize
You can do whatever you want. Assuming that you are in here tells me that you are good enough to customize and build your own, but you can also just copy it, it's good to go anyway.


## Dependencies
On some of the dotfiles, there are package dependencies, like (pathogen)[https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen], (z)[https://github.com/rupa/z/] and (NERDTree)[https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree].

I hope you can get it working!
