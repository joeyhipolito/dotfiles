# Joey's dofiles

I am super motivated to optimize my current workflow, organize my tools, customize my machine so that I will be working efficiently and in focus. I actully blogged about this setting up your dev area. You can check out the link here : [Blog] (http://blog.joeyhipolito.com)

# About the files

I cannot say that all files are made by me, that is just a ridiculous waste of time, but I make sure each code copied were deeply understood by me, google and read about what does what. Thank you for [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/), for being a great inspiration to me, your dotfiles are just awesome, I grabbed some of your code. 

# Note

I won't be showing, nor documenting on how to use the dotfiles, because neither I was told on how to use it. I guess exploring, googling how this works may help you understand it better than those who abruptly copied and pasted.*I almost told you how to use it*
